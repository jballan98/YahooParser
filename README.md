# YahooParser

- A parser for Yahoo Finance data, featuring several DCF models.
- The "Yahoo" model uses Yahooâ€™s calculated Free Cash Flows (FCFs), while the other templates can be adjusted on a stock-by-stock basis.
- The DCF template must be placed in the project folder, and an "info" folder is needed to store the output models.
- To use, simply replace the "ticker" with the desired stock ticker.
